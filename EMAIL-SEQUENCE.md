## Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 1)

### Version A: Dr. TeeJay Tripp (Founder/CMO)

**Subject:** Built a WCAG-compliant redesign of Serenity's website - would love your feedback

---

Dr. Tripp,

I'm a web developer who specializes in healthcare websites, and I've completed a full redesign of Serenity Mental Health Centers' site as a proposal project.

**Why I built this:**
Your current website has accessibility gaps that could create ADA compliance exposure - forms that screen readers can't access, missing alt text on provider photos, color contrast issues. With healthcare providers facing increased scrutiny under Section 1557, I wanted to show what a fully compliant, modern alternative looks like.

**What's included:**
- All 35 locations with individual pages
- 100+ provider profiles with photos and credentials
- Treatment and condition pages
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Modern, mobile-first design

**See it live:** [YOUR_SITE_URL]

**Video walkthrough (2 min):** [YOUR_LOOM_URL]

I'd welcome any feedback, and if there's interest in exploring this further, I'm happy to connect with whoever handles digital initiatives at Serenity.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Version B: Tricia Pease (COO)

**Subject:** Reducing Serenity's ADA website compliance risk - completed redesign

---

Hi Tricia,

I'm reaching out because I've built a fully accessible redesign of Serenity Mental Health Centers' website that addresses compliance gaps on the current site.

**The risk:**
Healthcare providers accepting federal funding face ADA website lawsuits regularly - settlements typically run $10K-$100K+ plus remediation. Your current site has 15+ WCAG 2.1 AA violations including hidden form labels, missing skip navigation, and color contrast failures.

**What I've built:**
A complete, production-ready redesign with:
- 166 static pages (35 locations, 100+ providers)
- Full accessibility compliance
- Modern patient experience
- Optimized performance scores

**See it live:** [YOUR_SITE_URL]

**Video walkthrough (2 min):** [YOUR_LOOM_URL]

If web compliance is on your radar, I'd be happy to walk through the technical details with you or your team.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Version C: Jillian DiMarco (Media Contact)

**Subject:** Accessibility-compliant website redesign for Serenity - who should I connect with?

---

Hi Jillian,

I'm a developer who's completed a full redesign of Serenity Mental Health Centers' website with a focus on WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance.

The current site has gaps that could create legal exposure for healthcare providers, and I wanted to build out what a compliant, modern alternative would look like - including all 35 locations and 100+ provider profiles.

**See it live:** [YOUR_SITE_URL]

**Video walkthrough (2 min):** [YOUR_LOOM_URL]

I'm not sure if this falls under your purview or if there's someone on the operations or digital team I should connect with. Happy to send this to whoever handles website decisions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## Sending Tips

1. **Best times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am local time
2. **Stagger sends:** Don't email all three at the same hour (looks like mass-blast)
3. **Track opens:** Use a tool like Mailtrack or your CRM to see who engages
4. **Follow up on opens:** If someone opens multiple times but doesn't reply, they're interested - follow up sooner

## Key Talking Points

### Accessibility Issues Found on Current Site

| Issue | WCAG Violation | Risk Level |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Form labels hidden via CSS | 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | High |
| Missing alt text on images | 1.1.1 Non-text Content | High |
| Color contrast failures | 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum | Medium |
| No skip navigation | 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks | Medium |
| Missing aria-labels on buttons | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | Medium |

### Legal Context

- **ADA Title III** covers healthcare providers as "places of public accommodation"
- **Section 1557 (ACA)** requires effective communication for providers accepting federal funding
- **Typical settlements:** $10K-$100K+ plus remediation costs
- **Trend:** Healthcare is a top target for ADA website lawsuits

### What You Built

- 166 static pages
- 35 location pages with providers, hours, directions
- 100+ provider profiles with photos and credentials
- Treatment pages (TMS, Ketamine, Medication Management, etc.)

- Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Mobile-responsive design
- Optimized Core Web Vitals

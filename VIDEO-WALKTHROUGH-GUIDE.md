## Video Script (Copy & Paste into ElevenLabs)

```
Here's a quick walkthrough of the redesigned Serenity Mental Health website.

The homepage features a modern, accessible design with clear calls-to-action and information about their evidence-based treatment approach.

The provider directory includes over 100 mental health professionals with individual profile pages showing their credentials, specialties, and locations.

Each of the 35 clinic locations has its own page with address, hours, phone number, and the specific providers available at that location.

The site is fully mobile-responsive and meets WCAG 2.1 double-A accessibility standards - including keyboard navigation, proper color contrast, and screen reader support.

Treatment pages cover TMS therapy, ketamine treatment, medication management, and more. Condition pages help patients understand depression, anxiety, ADHD, and other concerns.

The entire site is built on Next.js with 166 static pages for fast load times and optimal search engine performance.

The site is fully WCAG 2.1 double-A accessible, mobile-responsive, and optimized for performance with 166 static pages.

## Alternative Script (Accessibility Focus - 60 seconds)

```
I've built a fully accessible redesign of Serenity Mental Health Centers' website.

The current site has several WCAG violations that could create ADA compliance risk. This redesign addresses all of them.

Here's the skip-to-content link for keyboard users. All form fields have proper labels and aria attributes. Color contrast meets the four-point-five to one ratio required by WCAG double-A.

The provider directory includes over 100 staff members with photos and credentials. Each of the 35 locations has a dedicated page.

The site is built on Next.js with 166 static pages for fast load times. It scores over 90 on Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, and SEO.

Everything is production-ready and documented.
